	*Word-Clone*

Word-Clone is a game modeled after Lexathon - an Android game

Group Members: Jason Szot, Logan Morris, Jamie Taylor and Eric Cooper

Instructions:
	1. Download the .zip file and extract the contents to a location of your preference.
	2. Open and run Mars_4_5.jar which is included in the zip file.
	3. Within Mars select Open File - navigate and select the main.asm file.
	4. Assemble, run, and have fun.

During Play:
	- When playing Word-Clone, for menu selections - do not hit 'Enter' after inputting your selection.
		(i.e. To choose the 'enter a word' option, just hit '2' and nothing else).

	- Option 3 quits the game, although you are given the option to Play again or end the program.
		(You must select between 1 and 2. You have to press the Enter key for this one!)

*Important: make sure that Mars is in the same directory as the rest of the files*

Features:
	- Text that displays when the program is reading files and loading into memory, to give the user a better understanding of what 
	is being done.
	- A menu with options to shuffle the characters in the box, enter a word, or quit
	- The menu knows when a choice that isn't listed has been selected, tells the user, and lets them make another choice.
	- The shuffle option shuffles every character in the box except for the center character. To get a new center character,
	and therefore a new game, choose the quit option, and then select Play Again.
	- The quit option gives you the choice to play again, which starts a brand new game with new words and characters. It 
	also gives you the option to exit the program.
	- All rules for choosing a word have been implemented. Entering a word that does not have the center character, or is
	otherwise not a possible word, will earn no points.
	- Scoring routine: 5 points for every correct word entered, 0 points for an incorrect word.
Limitations to Note:
	- During play occasionally, you may enter a valid word but the program tells you it is not. This is likely due to the word being entered
	  is not currently in the file that is loaded (not found).
	- Mars 4_5.jar and other files dependent on Word-Clone must all be located in the same directory location in order to run.
	- Exiting the program through abnormal means may cause the game to behave strangely if it is ran again. To quit the program, please
	choose option 3 on the menu, to quit.
