During Play:

	- Option 3 quits the game, although you are given the option to Play again or end the program.

*Important: make sure that Mars is in the same directory as the rest of the files*

Features/Limitations to Note:
	- During play occasionally, you may enter a valid word but the program tells you it is not. This is likely due to the word being entered
